        What laid under the Juggernaut's mask, none could say. The last of his
        kind, Yurnero carries alone the martial traditions of his native isle, now
        sunken forever beneath the waves. Dancing with his Blade, the
        Juggernaut elevates swordplay to an art form, Swiftly Slashing foes in
        an unstoppable Blade Fury, striking the most vulnerable spots. With
        skills honed to such perfection, Yurnero can keep on Slashing and
        Dashing between opponents while giving them absolutely no chance
        to retaliate even in the slightest. Their only option to escape this
        onslaught is to book it as quickly as possible. After eviscerating his
        foes, Yurnero places his portable mobile Healing Ward that emits
        meditative energies to revitalize himself and nearby allies.
